# THIS GEM IS DEPRECATED

This gem is no longer maintained by Degica. Please consult the [Komoju Docs](https://docs.komoju.com) for other ways of integrating your e-commerce site with Komoju.

SpreeKomoju
===========

SpreeKomoju provides a comprehensive integration for all [Komoju](https://docs.komoju.com) payment methods with a single gem, including Credit Card, Konbini, PayEasy, and Bank Transfer.

Installation
------------

Add spree_komoju to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_komoju'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_komoju:install
```

Webhooks
--------

You will need to [setup a webhook](https://docs.komoju.com/api/webhooks) to complete non credit card
payments options. This is because payment options like Konbini, Bank Transfer, etc. are completed offline.

Adding spree_komoju will expose a new route `http://localhost:3000/komoju/callback` which expects
a `payment.captured` webhook. You can configure a [secret token](https://docs.komoju.com/api/webhooks#secret_token)
for your callback endpoint using the following configuration code:

```ruby
# config/initializers/spree_komoju.rb
SpreeKomoju.komoju_webhook_secret_token = 'MY WEBHOOK SECRET'
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_komoju/factories'
```
